Thanks for you interest in empowering reflection and self-awareness with data and AI! 

**StayReflective** is currently in development. We have several prototypes, a closed beta and are actively setting up and running a few small-scale pilots built to test and understand core user needs, validate value propositions and prove technical feasibility. 

*Code to Play?* We are committed to publishing, open source and share as much of we can as we develop and launch our products and services. You can check out some of the open source components and projects we have on Github including [QS Ledger](https://github.com/markwk/qs_ledger) - Quantified Self Personal Data Aggregator and Data Analysis and [Quantified Chatgpt](https://github.com/markwk/quantified_chatgpt). 

*Want to read more?* Many of our core concepts, write-ups and case studies around tracking, behavior change, and goal pursuit were published at [www.markwk.com/category/track-everything/](http://www.markwk.com/category/track-everything/). 

If you are interested in leveraging data and/or AI to empower reflection, we would love to chat!
